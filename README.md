- Hi, I’m @Cal-Kitchiti
- Professionally I've been a carpenter for two decades (of wood not words) yet I grew up with computers and even built several in my teenage years. In the past 5 years programming, pentesting, and digital products have piqued my attention! 
- I’m interested in programming and software development mainly, however, I am more interested in intelligent humans to network with!
- I’m currently learning Lua (how to develop on Roblox).
- I'll learn anything that can be taught but I am passionately seeking useful and immediately applicable knowledge to stay sharp on the cutting edge of technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software development across all platforms, applications, and games.
- 📫 How to reach me = belacofjudah@outlook.com
- Looking forward, Cal.
